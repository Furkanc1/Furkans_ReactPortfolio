            I am Furkan Coskun, Beginner Full-Stack software developer, in the process of creating a React.js APP portfolio, in order to showcase my ability to potential employers. 
            Building my coding knowledge up from essentially Zero with my brother, we attended a Coding Full-Stack course in order to really get a jumping start to persue our goal of becoming a coder in a world of technology, which grows and gets more and more complex by the day.
            Going through the Bootcamp has really exposed me to a a new world where technology can be used to create anything that one could think of, the hard part however, is to be skilled enough to be able to point the computer in the direction of what you want it do do. Although there is MUCH left to learn, I am confident that with the proper dicipline, practice, and real-world experience, I will be able to create anything I put my mind to, as well as establish myself as a great coder!
